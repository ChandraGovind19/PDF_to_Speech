BA6-Individual Reflection 
This past semester in ENGR-175 was interesting and fun. I learned a lot about various 
topics and also enjoyed the work I did with my group mates. Some lessons I learned during this 
semester include proper communication methods, the importance of data visualization, and what 
a proper team environment looked like. During our group work, we had to make sure our 
communication was on point, so we all got our work done on time and knew what our tasks were 
for each assignment. We used our group chat to communicate when we weren’t together during 
labs or lectures, and it worked effectively. Everyone was actively communicating, and it made 
the processes of doing assignments very smooth. We had certain assignments where we had to 
visualize data and through that I learned how much better data is to explain when it is shown 
using visuals such as graphs. For our presentation we showed our data with graphs, and it helped 
for us to explain it better. One last lesson was how a proper team environment looks like. We all 
had proper communication and also all did our parts. An important aspect that we had that made 
the team environment better was that someone would take over for another member if any of us 
were busy and couldn’t do all of our deliverables and this helped with team chemistry and was a 
lesson on how to take after your other team members.  
I wouldn’t say there were many challenges that I went through during the semester. 
Everything was smooth and I was on top of everything that needed to be done. I think everything 
being straightforward helped with that and aided with a positive experience this semester. 
As said earlier, my team collaboration experience went very well. Even though I was 
paired with peers that I did not know of before, we all got along fast and all seemed enthusiastic

about our project and the assignments we’d take part in during the semester. All of us were 
always on top of our deliverables and knew what to do and always got the work done on time. 
We used our group chat as our main source of communication, and it worked effectively during 
the semester as everyone was properly communication and we didn’t have to go around trying to 
get a hold of anyone. There were no issues that occurred, and everything went well throughout 
the semester.  
For some broad takeaways from the project. I learned a good amount on how AI is used 
by other students and noticed that a majority of students have similar experiences. I noticed that 
most students use AI with their school assignments and most of them use ChatGPT as their main 
LLM. A lot of them also think that AI made their major easier which makes sense as most of the 
participants belonged to the School of Engineering. The project really illustrated how students in 
UC Merced use AI and how they feel about AI use.  
Overall, this was a successful semester where I learned a lot about Information Systems 
and AI use with Students. I had a good time with my group on all the project work and 
everything was done effectively.
